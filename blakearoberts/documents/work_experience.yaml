    Workiva is an enterprise software company. Their main product is wDesk. As
    a infrastructure software engineer, I started working after my second year
    at Iowa State University. At Workiva I worked on messaging systems such as
    NATS as well as Amazon MQ (AWS ActiveMQ). Additionally, I worked on
    application intelligence systems and standards accomplishing system wide
    logging and application metric reporting. My work has given me experience
    writing multilanguage SDK's (Go, Python (2 and 3), Java, and Dart).
    Additionally, I gained experience working with AWS systems (namely Kinesis,
    Lambda, and EKS).

    Global Vet Link (GVL) provides a single page web application allowing
    veterinarians, animal owners, and pharmaceutical companies to move their
    animal documents (such as a VFD or Veterinary Food Directive) to the cloud.
    I started full stack development at GVL after my first year at Iowa State
    University. I helped create database backup and restore admin features on
    their Groovy on Grails system. I also developed several intuitive UX
    features on their frontend CoffeeScript MVC framework, Spine.js.
