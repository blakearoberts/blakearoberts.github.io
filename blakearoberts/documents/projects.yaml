    Harbinger is a proof of concept messaging application utilizing an
    integration of Spine.js and Google Firebase. Spine.js is a MVC SPA web
    framework written in CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript is transpiled to
    JavaScript. Spine.js utilizes an NPM tool called Hem to build static,
    stateless resources. Spine.js works out of the box with a browser cache
    data store. It is also readily able to integrate via ajax and a back end
    REST API. Harbinger utilizes an integration between Spine.js and Firebase
    which replaces the ajax functionality within Spine.js with a JS Firebase
    client to accomplish data persistance.

    Spot Finder is a parking assistance app for Android. I worked on the
    server, a REST API build with Java Spring. The application connected to a
    relational database (MySQL) housing information on parking spots. The back
    end stateless server completed REST-ful API calls to requests such as
    check in and checkout. Additionally, the back end served admin users as a
    tool to setup new parking lots. When an admin registered a new spot, a
    QR-code was generated and associated with that spot. The QR-code was an
    encoded REST request to toggle the availability of the spot. In other
    words, an application user would take a picture of the QR-code posted at
    their spot to toggle the spot's availability.
